                    on this project. wAIste is an innovative project that utilizes AI technology to streamline waste management and recycling efforts. The platform allows users to upload images of various waste items, which are then analyzed by AI algorithms to determine the appropriate recycling category. What distinguishes wAIste is its employment of two distinct AI models: one dedicated to general waste classification, and another specialized in advanced garbage identification. In the future, we plan to further enhance wAIste by integrating additional features and expanding its capabilities. This includes improving the accuracy of AI predictions, adding support for different types of waste materials, and incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience. We also aim to explore partnerships with recycling organizations and municipalities to scale the impact of wAIste and promote sustainable waste management on a larger scale.
