            overview: 'The PlanetTerp Chatbot is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to enhance the experience of using the Planet Terp website. Planet Terp is where University of Maryland students can access reviews and ratings of courses, professors, and grade distributions. Unlike traditional search tools, this chatbot offers a fully interactive and immersive experience, allowing students to ask questions naturally and receive detailed responses. Key features include real-time retrieval of course reviews, professor ratings, historical grade distributions, and fun facts about UMD. The chatbot also supports chat history, enabling users to maintain context across conversations, and includes a sidebar with essential UMD-related resources to assist students in navigating their academic journey effectively. With its advanced AI capabilities, the chatbot streamlines the process of finding relevant academic information, helping students make well-informed decisions about their courses and professors.',
            techDetails: 'The chatbot is developed using Python and built on Streamlit, a powerful framework for creating interactive web applications. This enables a clean and user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless interaction. The chatbot‚Äôs AI-powered responses are made possible through the Google Gemini API, allowing it to generate context-aware, precise answers to user queries. To enhance search efficiency, the chatbot incorporates semantic search, ensuring students receive the most relevant information based on their input. A structured backend system handles query processing, and caching mechanisms are implemented to optimize response times, minimizing delays and improving user experience.',

                    on this project. wAIste is an innovative project that utilizes AI technology to streamline waste management and recycling efforts. The platform allows users to upload images of various waste items, which are then analyzed by AI algorithms to determine the appropriate recycling category. What distinguishes wAIste is its employment of two distinct AI models: one dedicated to general waste classification, and another specialized in advanced garbage identification. In the future, we plan to further enhance wAIste by integrating additional features and expanding its capabilities. This includes improving the accuracy of AI predictions, adding support for different types of waste materials, and incorporating user feedback to enhance the user experience. We also aim to explore partnerships with recycling organizations and municipalities to scale the impact of wAIste and promote sustainable waste management on a larger scale.
